Are you planning on using Linear Regression on your dataset? 
I can help identify common problems with linear regression models.


Do you know if your data is heteroskedastic? Are you sure your variables have a linear relationship? 

Do your residuals follow a normal distribution?

Ask your doctor if linear regression is right for you.
